# Scroll Down Sports — Project Intent

## Why this exists

People miss games.  
Traditional highlight feeds spoil everything too fast.

This app lets fans:

- catch up at their own pace
- see context before outcomes
- avoid random opinions and noise
- consume games like a story rather than a feed

## Principles

- MVP first, polish second
- spoiler control is sacred
- simple UI > fancy UI
- iterate without breaking trust

## Scope

Start with:

- recap flows
- play-by-play summaries
- structured embeds (no messy social widgets)

Expand thoughtfully only when it improves experience.

## AI + Dev Expectations

- don’t overbuild abstractions
- keep changes reversible
- document meaningful behavior differences
- always maintain spoiler-awareness

Everything ladders back to:
“Does this help users follow a game — without ruining it?”
